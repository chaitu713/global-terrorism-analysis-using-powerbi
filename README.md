Global Terrorism Analysis using PowerBI

  - This particular dataset is concerned with global terrorism data that is over the past few decades like what is the terrorism all over the globe.
  - It provides various factors through which we can analyze the various weapon types, the various groups and the various targeted citizens.

  The steps I followed in this project are :
  
    1. Cleaned the Data like deleting the columns which are not required for our analysis, Renaming the column names to better understand them, Removing Blank Values from the Data.
    2. Created Donut Charts, Map Visual to see Terrorism Success Rate by Country, Applied Slicers (For Country and Year), Bar Charts, KPI Cards and Bar Chart to visualize the insights we found from the Data.
    3. Published the report to PowerBI service to share it to people online.
